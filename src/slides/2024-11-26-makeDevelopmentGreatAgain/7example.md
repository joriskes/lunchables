### The boat races:
> Instead of a traditional race, each boat has a fixed time to travel as far as possible. Your boatâ€™s speed increases the longer you hold down its button at the start (in whole ms), but the time you hold it reduces the time left for the boat to move. You need to beat the record distance for each race (in mm). But that's not all, we need to know the number of ways the race can be won.

There are two races in the example input
```
Time:      7  15
Distance:  9  40
```

#### Race 1
> The first race takes 7 milliseconds and the record is 9 mm
