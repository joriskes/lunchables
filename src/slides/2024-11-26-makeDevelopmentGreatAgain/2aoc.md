> Advent of Code is an _Advent calendar_ of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
